### Webstorm
- To install WebStorm you have to use JetBrains. To do this you have to go to the JetStorm website. Then log in to JetBrains using your email address and password. If you don't have an account, you may create a new account. Once you log into your account you have to search for the WebStorm application. Before downloading the application, if you are a student at a university, you can have a student license to use WebStorm for free. Once you download WebStorm you need to follow the instructions when you boot up WebStorm for the first time. After those instructions are complete you can freely use the application.
### Git
- Installing Git on the otherhand is pretty straightforward. Install git on your device whether its a mac, windows, and linux.
