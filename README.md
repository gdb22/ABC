## How to install Webstorm and Git 
### Webstorm
- To install WebStorm you have to use JetBrains. To do this you have to go to the JetBrains website. Then log in to JetBrains using your email address and password. If you don't have an account, you may create a new account. Once you log into your account you have to search for the WebStorm application. Before downloading the application, if you are a student at a university, you can have a student license to use WebStorm for free. Once you download WebStorm you need to follow the instructions when you boot up WebStorm for the first time. After those instructions are complete you can freely use the application.
### Git
- Installing Git on the other hand is pretty straightforward. Go to the Git website and install Git on your device whether it's a mac, windows, or Linux. There are multiple Gits to download but choose one that you would like to download. After that follow the instructions on how to set up Git and after that you should be good to go.

## How to use GitHub and Webstorm
### Github
- Go to the GitHub website. Once you're on the site create a GitHub account. After creating an account, you can see a lot of things on GitHub. The first thing you can do is create repositories, which are used to store code. Another thing you can do is cloning your repsitories', which provide a replication of your code. You can also commit which just saves your work and provides the history of changes made throughout your code. The great thing about GitHub is that it allows potential employers to see your projects. A video will be provided which will provide an in depth tutorial of GitHub.
### Webstorm
- Assuming you have downloaded WebStorm, there are many things that you can do. You can create a repository on WebStorm, or you can import a repository from GitHub. Another thing that you can do is create a WebStorm file, where you can write HTML code. A great feature is that you can add files to Git on WebStorm. You can also commit changes which save your work and provide a history of changes made on your file. Most of the features mentioned are similar to GitHub. There are more features, but they are very advanced for beginners.
